What have I learnt?

Today we learnt about Html which gives our data structure and also how to add css tags to make the text a different colour and also how to highlight text with a strong tag.
we found out how to open and close the tags. Stand alone elements are the only ones that require no closing tag. 
you should indent your code to provide the code with a more coherent structure. headings are also important. we learnt about how to add images, ordered and unordered lists to our code and create headings in our code.

How did I use this in practice?

In this lesson we added strong tags and element tags into our code.

What did I find hard?
I found this lesson coherent and easy to follow.
