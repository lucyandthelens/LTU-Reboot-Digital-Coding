  <h3>CPD activity</h3>
  <h3>Introduction to Web Development</h3>
  
  
 <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
  
<p>I learnt about the different positions in web development, like what a front end developer is and does....
  end developer and a back end developer does. I also learnt how to create a repository which is a different way of saying project. </p>
  
 <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4> 
 <p>We created a repository by logging in to git hub web and creating our own read me page which is similar to an about me on the web.
  we added a description. Then we used a fork to create a seperate repository and cloned it to the desktop version. Then we copied this into our visual studio code editor</p> 

  <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
<p> So far i found the lesson relatively straight forward to follow.</p>

<h3>CPD activity</h3>
<h3>Learning To Code </h3>

<h4>What have I learnt?</h4>

<p>Today i learnt about change management which is how to alloew your website or app to run on different browsers or devices.
  Git is a version control system which provides us with a 'save game'type history. Always add a message so you know what you did. we also learnt how to create new branches and commit to that branch.
  Also whenever we change something in code we commit. We also learnt about how to create headings and paragraphs in code.
</p>

<h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>

<p>moved our cpd.text into our index.html page and created headings from h1 to h4 using html code. </p> 

<h4>What did I find hard?</h4>

<p>My computer doesn't like the paragraph tag but other than that it was all good</p>

<h3>CPD activity</h3>
<h3>Positioning And Layout</h3>


<h4>What have I learnt?</h4>

<p>we learnt about Html which gives our data structure and also how to add css tags to make the text a different colour and also how to highlight text with a strong tag.
we found out how to open and close the tags. Stand alone elements are the only ones that require no closing tag. 
you should indent your code to provide the code with a more coherent structure. headings are also important. we learnt about how to add images, ordered and unordered lists to our code and create headings in our code.</p> 

<h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>

<p> In this lesson we added strong tags and element tags into our code.</p>

<h4>What did I find hard?</h4>

<p> I found this lesson coherent and easy to follow.</p>

<h4>What Were The Results Of The HTML And CSS Quizzes</h4>
 
  <p>On The HTML Quiz I Scored 50% and on the CSS Quiz I Scored 44% so I still feel I have lots to learn</p>

<h3>CPD activity</h3>
<h3> HTML And CSS: Positioning And Layout</h3>

<h4>What have I learnt?</h4>

<p>Today I learnt about static Positioning, relative Positioning and absolute Positioning. <br> 
Static doesn't move, relative allows the content to move to the left, right or bottom and absolute positioning 
allows the content to move outside of the normal flow. We also learnt about z index which is where elements overlap and you can change the order</p>

<h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>

<p> We added images to our code using Href and SRC.</p> 

<h4>What did I find hard?</h4>

<p> Adding an image was difficult as my mac trackpad wouldn't right click to copy the image address but we realised that I had to press control.</p>

<h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>

<p>We floated some elements left and right and added some local image files</p>

<h4>What did I find hard?</h4>

<p>I wasn't sure if I could keep up but managed it</p>
