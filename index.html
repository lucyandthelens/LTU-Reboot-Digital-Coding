 <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
  
<p>I learnt about the different positions in web development, like what a front end developer is and does....
  end developer and a back end developer does. I also learnt how to create a repository which is a different way of saying project. </p>
  
 <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4> 
 <p>We created a repository by logging in to git hub web and creating our own read me page which is similar to an about me on the web.
  we added a description. Then we used a fork to create a seperate repository and cloned it to the desktop version. Then we copied this into our visual studio code editor</p> 

  <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
<p> So far i found the lesson relatively straight forward to follow.</p>

<h4>What have I learnt?</h4>

<p>Today i learnt about change management which is how to alloew your website or app to run on different browsers or devices.
  Git is a version control system which provides us with a 'save game'type history. Always add a message so you know what you did. we also learnt how to create new branches and commit to that branch.
  Also whenever we change something in code we commit. We also learnt about how to create headings and paragraphs in code.
</p>

<h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>

<p>moved our cpd.text into our index.html page and created headings from h1 to h4 using html code. </p> 

<h4>What did I find hard?</h4>

<p>My computer doesn't like the paragraph tag but other than that it was all good</p>
