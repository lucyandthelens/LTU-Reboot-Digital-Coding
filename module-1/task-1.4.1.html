  CPD activity
  Introduction to Web Development
  
  
  What have I learnt?
  
  I learnt about the different positions in web development, like what a front end developer is and does....
  end developer and a back end developer does. I also learnt how to create a repository which is a different way of saying project.
  
  How did I use this in practice?
  We created a repository by logging in to git hub web and creating our own read me page which is similar to an about me on the web.
  we added a description. Then we used a fork to create a seperate repository and cloned it to the desktop version. Then we copied this into our visual studio code editor
  
  
  
  What did I find hard?
  So far i found the lesson relatively straight forward to follow.
